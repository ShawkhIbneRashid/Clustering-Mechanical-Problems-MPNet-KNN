US6777841B2,"Owing to the contactless bearing, the known magnetic bearings always have a continuous bearing gap, and gas and vapor can thus pass through them between the two sides which are connected by the bearing gap. Environmental air and moisture contained in it can thus enter the bearing gap, or can reach the rotor through the bearing gap. This results in the risk of the air humidity freezing on the cold components of the magnetic bearing or else of the rotor, if this is cooled, with such icing resulting in a restriction to operation, or even in damage to the magnetic bearing. Furthermore, the cooling processes with liquid coolant (cryogenic medium), in general liquid nitrogen, which are used exclusively for the superconductors of the described magnetic bearing according to the related art, are generally also subject to sealing problems in the region of the sensitive magnetic bearings, in addition to the problem of any moisture that has entered freezing on the cryogenic medium supply lines that are required, once again increasing the risk of icing or of other malfunctions of the magnetic bearing.. As a further measure, a cooling device having at least one cold head, which is thermally coupled to the superconductor and dissipates heat from the superconductor mainly by thermal conduction as the heat transfer mechanism, is now provided for cooling the superconductor of the magnetic bearing or of each magnetic bearing. The use, as proposed, of a cold head (which in principle is known per se) for indirect cooling of the magnetic bearing is a considerably simpler solution in terms of design and handling than the direct cooling, as provided in the related art, via a liquid cooling medium. A cold head can easily be fitted to the magnetic bearing as a connecting piece for heat transmission. Furthermore, the use of one or more cold heads ensures deliberate cooling of the superconductor in the magnetic bearing and avoids the problems of the emergence (which can never entirely be avoided) of cryogenic liquid and the uncontrolled thermal conditions that result from this, with the risk of icing of the magnetic bearings as a result of freezing of residual moisture in the gas atmosphere or of moisture contained in the evaporated cryogenic medium.. The gas area of the device, in which the rotor and the magnetic bearing are arranged, is generally filled with a gas or a gas mixture which is used for thermal conduction for cooling of those components which need to be cooled and for this purpose makes contact with them and is therefore also referred to as the contact gas. This gas generally remains in the gas area throughout the operating life of the device. The contact gas is therefore in one advantageous embodiment an inert gas or a mixture of inert gases, with helium or neon being preferable, although nitrogen can be used for correspondingly high operating temperatures. Furthermore, in principle, hydrogen or oxygen are also suitable, although their handling is somewhat more problematic.. The gas pressure of the gas in the gas area in one advantageous embodiment is preferably at least as high as, and preferably higher than, the gas pressure in the outer area surrounding the wall of the gas area, in general atmospheric pressure. Even in the event of sealing problems or leakages in the area of the gas area wall, this reliably prevents the ingress of moist air and the possibility of ice being formed in consequence in the cold area.",any moisture that has entered freezing on the cryogenic medium supply lines that are required

CN105634170A,"One of known chiller has a problem in that the path being easiest to will always be followed by gaseous coolant, and this causes insufficient cooling of winding overhang. Why such reason is in that in the chamber that winding overhang extends between electromotor and generator housing. Staggered winding ends extends to certain distance outside the end of stator, and the half-turn of outermost winding is effectively presented as the barrier to any gas cooling medium or encumbrance. Due to a variety of causes, chamber between outer end and the generator housing of winding overhang is necessary, for instance because of design tolerance etc., or longer generator housing can be designed to hold longer stator afterwards, but house shorter stator at first so that chamber is relatively large at first. In described chamber, gaseous coolant will tend to flowing only around winding overhang to the road of air gap at it, thus effectively walking around compact winding overhang. As a result, the temperature in winding overhang can significantly than the temperature heat of the winding halfbody between stator teeth. As indicated above, the power output of electromotor is by temperature limiting the hottest in winding. Additionally, the conductivity of winding ends increases along with their temperature and reduces, therefore increase the hot dependent loss of electromotor.",insufficient cooling of winding overhang
US9803694B2,The bearing of a wind turbine has a clearance of approximately −0.1 to 0.2 mm In order to control the lifetime and air-gap of the generator it is advantageous to control the clearance. The problem is that the inner ring of the bearing heats up and expands which leads to reduced lifetime of the bearing. The reason for the heat up is that the inner ring of the bearing together with the shaft structure has a small mass/stiffness compared to the mass/structure of the outer ring. This means that the average temperature of the inner ring is higher than the average temperature of the outer ring and structure around the outer ring.,the inner ring of the bearing heats up and expands

EP3456961A1,"Wind turbines are installed at locations with varied weather conditions. When installed at cold locations, icing on any exposed part of a wind turbine, especially on a rotor blade of the wind turbine, can occur and cause decreased performance of the wind turbine resulting into production losses. Furthermore when ice accumulates on one or more of the rotor blades of a wind turbine, excess vibration problems from uneven blade icing may occur. The accumulated ice may generate excessive mechanical loads on the wind turbine rotor blade posing problems to structural integrity of the rotor blade and leading eventually to wind turbine shut-down or to wind turbine faults.. Problems related to icing of rotor blades of wind turbines can be prevented by at least one of two different measures: a first measure is de-icing in which accumulated or accreted ice from the rotor blade is removed, and the other measure is anti-icing in which accretion or accumulation of ice on the rotor blade is avoided or obviated.",excess vibration problems
US20110285142A1,"The aforementioned type of insulation used in the slot of the machines with conventional windings, results in different disadvantages: Poor heat transfer coefficient of the insulation makes it very difficult for the main source of heat in the generator, i.e. the windings, to get cooled down through the neighbouring laminations.

CN104806458B,"In direct drive wind turbines with external rotors, the magnets are not accessible to such internal cooling circuits. Prior art direct drive external rotor wind turbines therefore rely on convective cooling to cool the rotor as it rotates through the ambient air. However, the cooling effect is limited. Direct cooling of the magnets becomes difficult because they are mounted in the outer rotor and access to the magnet surface is limited to a very narrow air gap between the magnets and the windings on the inner stator. Therefore, prior art cooling mechanisms are characterized by poor performance relative to their ability to cool permanent magnets in the external rotor of a direct drive wind turbine. Furthermore, in air cooling systems, the stator windings dissipate heat to the air flow directed through the windings. This heated air in turn gives off heat to the magnets which have been heated by the thermal radiation given off by the windings, thereby exacerbating the problem.. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved cooling mechanism which overcomes the above mentioned problems.",Direct cooling of the magnets becomes difficult

EP3054565A1,"In one approach to cooling such a generator, a gaseous coolant such as air can be blown into the air-gap, where it absorbs heat from the windings. The warmed air can then be expelled from the generator. Alternatively, the air can pass from the air-gap through radial channels in the stator body and into the stator interior. In one type of generator design, a pair of windings is arranged between adjacent stator teeth, leaving an axial channel between the windings, and the cooling airflow can enter this space to absorb heat from the windings. A problem with this type of cooling arrangement is that the gaseous coolant will always follow the easiest path and may therefore not always reach the hot winding regions. This leads to an insufficient cooling of the windings.",an insufficient cooling of the windings
US20190277263A1,"Considerable quantities of heat can be generated during operation of a wind turbine. A primary source of heat is in the windings of the generator, since these are generally thick copper conductors that carry very high currents. Since the performance of a generator can decrease if the temperature in the windings becomes too high, various systems have been developed to ensure that the generator temperature remains at an acceptable level. Generally, some fluid coolant is used to absorb heat from the generator. For example, a cooling system can be realized to draw cool air through the generator air gap so that the air absorbs heat from the windings and magnets. The advantage of such a cooling arrangement is that the coolant—air—is readily available and can be easily guided through the very narrow generator air-gap. However, a problem with this type of cooling arrangement is that any moisture or airborne particles in the air can cause damage to the generator. Also, it is not always practicable to remove moisture and salt from cold air, so that the relative humidity of the air entering the generator can exceed a desired level. Moisture and salt carried in the air can lead to corrosion damage and problems with electrical circuits.",any moisture or airborne particles in the air can cause damage to the generator
US20200116133A1,"However, the disadvantages of this approach are the relatively large number of fan motors required; the higher probability of leakages of fluid coolant from the heat exchangers; the number of manifolds required for the cooling units; and a significant drop in performance in the event of a fan failure. When a fan stops functioning for some reason, the cooler to which it is connected is also effectively unable to function, since the air is no longer being sucked through the cooling matrix. The cooling capacity of such an arrangement is quantified as the product n·U·A, where n is the number of (identical) cooling units, U is the heat transfer coefficient of a cooling unit, and A is the heat exchanger area of a cooling unit. Clearly, failure of one or more fans will significantly reduce the cooling capacity.. A further problem arises since the fans and the main shaft are exposed to hot air leaving the armature. When a fan is surrounded by hot air, thermal overload relay (TOR) may cause the fan motor to cut out upon reaching a too-high temperature. The temperature of the main shaft is of particular concern also because electrical components are usually installed in the relatively large space inside the shaft. Heat from the generator can reach the main shaft and heat the interior of the main shaft. High temperatures within the main shaft may result in having to shut down or down-regulate a generator to protect the electrical components from damage. Down-time and down-regulation result in loss of earnings to the wind turbine operator, and must therefore be taken seriously. For these reasons, in the known cooling arrangements it may be necessary to also provide a supply of low-temperature air for the electrical components within the main shaft. Furthermore, the space inside the main shaft is directly connected with the space inside the hub and also with the space inside the canopy or nacelle, where other electrical components are also usually installed. These components must also be protected from over-heating, and it may be necessary to provide additional cooling in the hub and canopy also. Therefore, the known cooling arrangements are generally associated with unfavourably high installation costs and running costs.",failure of one or more fans will significantly reduce the cooling capacity
US8729750B2,"Thereby, the problem of high pressure losses of the gaseous cooling medium has to be encountered within the radial channels. The pressure losses are mainly based on flow separation of the gaseous cooling medium and may significantly diminish the cooling performance.. The present invention is based on the idea to provide the at least one transition area from the stator stack in at least one respective radial channel with an aerodynamic shape, i.e. the respective transition area has a curved and/or chamfered and/or stepped shape. In such a manner, the problem of pressure losses of the gaseous cooling medium in the respective radial channels serving as air-ducts is encountered. As a result, the cooling capability may be increased since the distribution of the flow rate of the gaseous cooling medium through the respective radial channels is improved, i.e. respective differences of the flow rate in axial and radial direction are essentially diminished leading to an essentially even distribution of the flow rate both in axial and radial direction, that is axially along the stator stack as well as radially through the respective radial channels.",high pressure losses of the gaseous cooling medium
JP2011152035A,"In order to achieve coupling of the magnetic field, permanent magnets are used for the electromechanical transducer, in particular its rotor. Recently, especially rare earth magnetic materials have been introduced, so permanent magnet electromechanical transducers that do not require commutators or brushes are widely used with conventional DC electromechanical transducers. . Since there is no excitation by an external rotor, rotor losses are reduced and permanent magnet electromechanical transducers are efficient. Further, by designing the permanent magnet type electromechanical transducer in a brushless manner, the induction coil can be arranged in the stationary stator. In this respect, a non-permanent magnet type electromechanical transducer having a commutator and a brush and not having a permanent magnet has the disadvantage of high maintenance costs.
 . 
 One technical problem with permanent magnet electromechanical transducers is the generation of cogging torque. Cogging torque is generated between the rotor and the stator on which the permanent magnet is attached, by approaching the rotor magnet and the stator coil at a steep edge when the permanent magnet type electromechanical transducer is operating. When cogging torque is generated, output ripple (also referred to as torque ripple) is generated, which has the undesirable effect of causing vibration and thus noise in the electromechanical transducer.",cogging torque
